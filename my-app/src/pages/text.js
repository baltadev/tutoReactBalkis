    <h2>Shame</h2>
<p> Well there's three versions of this story mine and yours </p>
<p>And then the truth</p>
<p>Now we can put it down to circumstance, our childhood, then our youth</p>
<p>Out of some sentimental gain I wanted you to feel my pain,</p>
<p>But it came back return to sender</p>
<p>I read your mind and tried to call,</p>
<p>My tears could fill the Albert Hall,</p>
<p>Is this the sound of sweet surrender?</p>
<p>What a shame we never listened</p>
<p>I told you through the television</p>
<p>And all that went away was the price we paid</p>
<p>People spend a lifetime this way</p>
<p>Oh what a shame.</p>
<p>So I got busy throwing everybody underneath the bus, oh</p>
<p>And with your poster 30 foot high at the back of Toys-R-Us</p>
<p>I wrote a letter in my mind,</p>
<p>But the words were so unkind,</p>
<p>About a man I can't remember</p>
<p>I don't recall the reasons why,</p>
<p>I must have meant them at the time</p>
<p>Is this the sound of sweet surrender?</p>
<p>What a shame we never listened</p>
<p>I told you through the television</p>
<p>And all that went away was the price we paid</p>
<p>People spend a lifetime this way</p>
<p>And that's how they stay</p>
<p>Oh what a shame.</p>
<p>Words come easy</p>
<p>When they're true</p>
<p>Words come easy
<p>When they're true</p>
<p>So I got busy throwing everybody underneath the bus</p>
<p>And with your poster 30 foot high at the back of Toys-R-Us</p>
<p>Now we can put it down to circumstance, our childhood then our youth.</p>
<p>What a shame we never listened</p>
<p>I told you through the television</p>
<p>And all that went away was the price we paid</p>
<p>People spend a lifetime this way</p>
<p>And that's how they stay</p>
<p>People spend a lifetime this way</p>
<p>Oh what a shame</p>
<p>What a shame.</p>
<p>What a shame.</p>
<p>Ooh</p>
<p>Such a shame what a shame</p>
<p></p>Beautiful shame, real shame, and stuff double shame (shame, shame shame)</p>
