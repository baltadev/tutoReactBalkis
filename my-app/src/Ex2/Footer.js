       Videogames have been studied seriously only for a few years. So,
        we can wonder how we could use the recent academic works to approach new design methods.
         This article proposes a first step: a short and simple definition of what a videogame is, 
         this definition being connected with existing academic works about game, play, interactivity, 
         and narrative. The definition is: A videogame is a game which we play thanks to an audiovisual 
         apparatus and which can be based on a story.
       The article also shows what the videogame heritage teaches us about what a videogame is.
